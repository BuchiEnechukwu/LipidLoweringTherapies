# Identifying Gaps in Lipid-Lowering Therapy Uptake in North West London

This repository contains an R-based analysis supporting the North West London (NWL) Integrated Care System's long-term condition mission:  
**To prevent 25% of heart attacks and strokes by 2029, while addressing health inequalities.**

The task involved using **CVDPREVENT open data** to identify patients in NWL who may be eligible for **lipid-lowering therapy (LLT)** but are not currently on treatment, with a focus on both primary and secondary prevention. The work also includes forecasting trends and identifying potential inequalities in treatment uptake.



## Task Objectives

Commissioned as part of the NWL ICS Missions programme, this analysis addresses the following:

- 📌 **How many patients with existing CVD (secondary prevention) are not on LLT?**
- 📌 **How many high-risk patients (primary prevention) are not on LLT?**
- 📌 **Are there disparities in uptake across boroughs or population groups?**
- 📌 **What are the trends since Sept 2021, and what can we predict for the next 1–2 years?**

The analysis informs targeted interventions for reducing cardiovascular risk and improving equity across North West London.



## 📊 Data & Sources

- **Dataset:** NHS CVDPREVENT Data Extract (September 2021 – March 2024)
  - `CVDP009CHOL` – Treated with LLT (CVD, secondary prevention)
  - `CVDP008CHOL` – Treated with LLT (QRISK10, primary prevention)
- **Geography:** North West London Integrated Care System (borough-level)
- **Format:** Excel exports from NHS Digital



##  Methods Overview

- **Data Wrangling:** `readxl`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `janitor`
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Grouped and visualised LLT uptake across boroughs, risk groups, and time
- **Inequality Assessment:** Disaggregated by gender, borough, and QRISK score
- **Time Series Forecasting:** 
  - Created monthly time series objects (2021–2024)
  - Applied `auto.arima()` from the `forecast` package to predict LLT gaps up to 2026
  - Visualised predicted untreated high-risk populations

##  Key Insights

- Thousands of high-risk patients remain untreated in both primary and secondary prevention categories.
- Borough-level differences in LLT uptake suggest geographic inequalities.
- Forecasts show the gap in treatment may persist or widen without targeted interventions by 2026.

## Relevance
The findings inform public health and primary care strategies to close LLT gaps and improve secondary prevention in cardiovascular care—especially for high-risk and underserved populations.
